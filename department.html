                        <h4>School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCOPE)</h4>

                        <p>The mission of the School is to strive persistently for achieving excellence in computing
                            disciplines. It is being pursued through its spectrum of academic programmes in computing of
                            contemporary standards. The main aim is to produce computing graduates with potential, to
                            design and develop systems involving the integration of software and hardware devices,
                            employ innovative approaches in programming and problem solving and solving problems, create
                            Large Scale Software Systems and build data/computing infrastructure for an organization.
                        </p>

                        <p>History of computing discipline at VIT dates back to 1993, when the Department of Computer
                            Science & Engineering was established to meet the demand for well-qualified computer
                            professionals. The School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCOPE) was conceived in the
                            year 2009.</p>

                        <p>At present, the School headed by Dr. Saravanan R, has more than 7000 students and 158 core
                            faculty members apart from many visiting professors, distinguished professionals from
                            industry, eminent researchers and teaching/ research assistants. With an aim to carve a
                            niche for itself in Computer Science and allied domains, the School strives to:</p>
